Changes Made
1. Collapsed Files and Directories lists inside of Dir to just a list<Node>
    a. Changed the appropriate addFile/addDirectory to addNode
    b. Changed getFile/getDir to getChildren which returns a List<Node>
    c. Added method addNodes to add a list of nodes all at once
2. Removed Observer from Node because Files are not Observers
    a. Added Observer to Dir so that it can observe its children
3. Removed changeSize from File because it is duplicate code from Node.serBytesSize
4. Changed unnecessary public access modifiers to package-private
5. Changes FileSystem.java to use the new API provided by Node.java
    a. Changed the calls to addFile/addDir to addNode
    b. Changed printTree to only iterate over nodes that are returned from getChildren()

Note: Even though File is a duplicate of Node code-wise, we leave it as is to better follow the open/closed
    design principle, as in the future, one might want to implement special features that are specific
    to the File class such as setContents() or changeContents()
